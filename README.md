 Terminal Game Project 

    MedFer's Battle Ship

    You will be given four ships to place down on the board

    The board will consist of rows(horizontal) and columns(vertical) labeled 0 through 4

    When placing ships down on your board you will be prompted to pick a start point then an orientation

    After you select the point the orientation will place the ship horizontally to the right or vertically downward

    Keep this in mind so you do not place the ship off the board

    Then enjoy a normal game of BattleShip!

    - Thank you for playing
